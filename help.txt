there is one config file for player core, and separate file per plugin.

some examples:

Ctrl Alt c: toggle_pause

LAST.FM PLUGIN CONFIGURATION

create file in $HOME/.config/deadbeef/lastfm

you can see if it works by looking at lastfm profile page after you start playing music (it should say something like "now playing with DeaDBeeF")

also note, that it's subject to last.fm policy to submit songs under certain rules.
songs without at least Artist and Title tags will not be submitted.
