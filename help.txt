help file for deadbeef player

CONFIGURATION

currently GUI configuration is incomplete, so editing configuration file is a necessity.
since 0.3.0 release, all configuration is stored in single file:
$HOME/.config/deadbeef/config

generally, you should run player once, then exit it (to generate config), then edit it by hand.

HOTKEYS PLUGIN CONFIGURATION

syntax is following:

hotkeys.keyN <key_combination>: <action>

example (note the numbers - must be like that):

hotkeys.key1 Ctrl Alt c: toggle_pause
hotkeys.key2 Ctrl 0x76: prev
hotkeys.key3 Ctrl Alt b: next
hotkeys.key4 Ctrl Alt v: stop
hotkeys.key5 Ctrl Alt x: play
hotkeys.key6 Ctrl Alt n: play_random
hotkeys.key7 Super u: volume_up
hotkeys.key8 XF86AudioLowerVolume: volume_down

full list of actions:

toggle_pause, play, prev, next, stop, play_random, seek_fwd, seek_back, volume_up, volume_down

LAST.FM PLUGIN CONFIGURATION

lastfm.login <LOGIN>
lastfm.password <PASSWORD>

you can see if it works by looking at lastfm profile page after you start playing music (it should say something like "now playing with DeaDBeeF")

also note, that it's subject to last.fm policy to submit songs under certain rules.
songs without at least Artist and Title tags will not be submitted.
