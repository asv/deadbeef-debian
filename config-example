# alsa soundcard ID
# normally you should keep default here
# for secondary soundcard enter it's name as reported by "aplay -L"
# e.g. default:CARD=I82801DBICH4
# or   default:CARD=Audigy2
# or   default:CARD=Xio
alsa_soundcard default

# mixing frequency (samplerate)
# prefer native samplerate of your soundcard
# e.g. 48k for creative cards
# consult your soundcard manual if you don't want to get crappy results
samplerate 48000

# samplerate conversion quality
# that thing controls how your 44100 mp3s are being converted into soundcard samplerate (see above)
# 0 - sinc_best_quality (my pc can't handle that)
# 1 - sinc_medium_quality (good enough but still slow)
# 2 - sinc_fastest
# 3 - sinc_zero_order_hold
# 4 - linear
# sinc_fastest is a good balance between performance and quality.
# also, it gives best result on udial resampling test
# get it here, and check for yourself
